# Breast Cancer Neural Classifier
In this Breast Cancer Classification project, I developed a Neural Network, achieving 95% accuracy on training data and 97% accuracy on validation data. The model efficiently classifies test data. Data analysis and visualization were performed using pandas, matplotlib libraries, LabelEncoder, and MinMaxScaler, along with the use of LabelEncoder and MinMaxScaler.
